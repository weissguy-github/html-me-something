                <H3>Lost and Found</H3>
                <p>
                In February of 2014, my son-in-law rescued a young 
                Pit Bull from the cold streets of North St Louis city.  
                When told, my wife and I warned our daughter and son-in-law about 
                the liability and danger of having one of those ferocious beasts in their house. 
                Needless to say, they didn't listen.

                <p>
                It's worse than we thought. What we failed to realize at the time was not 
                only was this beast going to be in their house, but the beast 
                would spend time at our house. We were now grandparents 
                of an approximately two year old 65 lb. pile of bones, teeth, and muscle 
                Staffordshire Terrier mix, <em>aka Pit Bull</em>.

            <h3>People puppy</h3>
            <p>
                Lucky(?) for us, while strong as a bull and quite rambunctious in her early years, 
                she is a people person through and through. She sometimes even sits like people.

            <h3>Velcro dog</h3>
            <p>
                If you talk to owners of Pitties, you will find a common thread. 
                Deeply loyal, always at your side, on your side, against your side, in your lap... 
                they are like velcro. If you sit ...
            </p>

                ...or lie down, she will be on you or leaning against you 
                one way or another. Yes, it can be painful, but I have to admit it is kind of nice, too.

            <h3>A word to the wise...</h3>
            <p>Training is key... and keep training. Chloe is very bright, and strong willed.
                We were unable to break her of sleeping on the bed and getting on the 
                furniture. She is not at our house long enough to train her on 
                those things and that behavior is allowed at her home. 
                So when she visits, the furniture is covered.</p>

            <p>... and the old sheets go on the bed.</p>
