            <H3>Lost and Found</H3>
            <p>
                In February of 2014, we were told my son-in-law rescued a young 
                Pit Bull from the cold streets of North St Louis city.  
                My wife and I warned our daughter about the liability and 
                danger of having one of those ferocious beasts in their house.

            <H3>Even her muscles have muscles</H3>
            <p>
                What we failed to realize at the time, was just how much time the
                beast would spend at our house. We were now grandparents of an 
                approximately two year old 65 lb. pile of bones, teeth, and muscle 
                Staffordshire Terrier mix, <em>aka Pit Bull</em>.

            <h3>She even sits like a person</h3>
            <p>
                Lucky(?) for us, while strong as a bull and quite rambunctious in her early years, 
                she was a people person through and through.

            <h3>Plenty of exercise is key</h3>
            <p>Tired dogs are less likely to misbehave, especially young high energy dogs.</p>

            <h3>And of course, they're all angels when sleeping</h3>
            <p>She's a hoot, even when she sleeps</p>

            <h3>But, sometimes, maybe a cat would be better</h3>
            <p>Because ... SHE. CAN. WEAR. YOU. DOWN.</p>

            <h3>Velcro dog</h3>
            <p>
                If you talk to owners of Pitties, you will find a common thread. 
                Deeply loyal, always at you side, on your side, against your side, in your lap... 
                they are like velcro. If you sit ...
            </p>
            <img src="images\1439752587596.jpg">
            <p>
                ...or lie down, she will be on you or leaning against you 
                one way or another. Yes, it can be painful, but I have to admit it is kind of nice, too.

            <h3>A word to the wise...</h3>
            <p>Training is key... and keep training. Chloe is very bright, and strong willed.
                We were unable to break her of sleeping on the bed and getting on the 
                furniture because she is not at our house long enough to train her on 
                those things. We give in to her since those things are allowed at her home. 
                So now when she visits, the furniture is covered.</p>

            <p>... and the old sheets go on the bed.</p>
